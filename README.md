Final project for DGL-123 PHP fundamentals class

DGL-123: Final Project Summary
Student: Reginald McPherson

I started the project with the idea that I was going to merge my two final projects from CSS and from PHP and I worked on that for a few days before I started getting errors that I was not able to track down and I ended up splitting the two projects and both suffered quality issues due to trying to make up lost time. I’m not really worried about it I know I can do better next time.
I spent a lot of time on getting the database working but some I certainly missed a few “better practices” in my haste. I know quality over speed is generally preferred, but I wanted to walk away from this with a working prototype even if it was a bit hack job.
I was not able to export my database due to a version mismatch unfortunately, but I’ll include some screenshots of the database and the project too in case it’s too much hassle to get the database running on your machine.
It’s kind of funny, I have a way cool navigation bar on this project than my CSS project, and it’s even made with SASS but due to time limits I think I used bootstrap on my CSS project.
So, hurdles… well when I split the projects up again, I cut some corners and allowed myself to write some repetitive code that I thought I would come back and fix later, well it snowballed and there is no way I’m going to be able to fix that in the next 2 hours, so it is what it is. BUT I am going to fix it because that was my first project using a database and I really want to perfect it.  
One thing I really noticed near the end was feeling trapped by how my code was written, now I tried keeping it simple but it got away from me at some point and it hit me that if I had each function or operation as small as I could get it, it would have been much easier to mix and match as things got more complex.
For awhile there I regretted not doing the Simpson project, but I’ve learned a lot from this project. It’s a little Frankenstein, but it made me push and really see where some of my mistakes are coming from and use techniques I have only glanced over during our studies, like cookies, and reading/writing to MySQL database. It was fun!
